Excellent! It sounds like you are all set for a productive session. Using VS Code with WSL Debian is a powerful combination, and since you’ve already used it for LISP, you know how seamless the transition can be.

Since you've chosen TerosHDL, you have a fantastic toolbox that will help you visualize your circuits and manage both Verilog and VHDL in a single interface.

Final Quick Checklist
Just to ensure nothing was missed, here is the final list of software you should have inside your WSL Debian terminal:

Simulators: iverilog (Verilog) and ghdl (VHDL).

Viewer: gtkwave.

Automation: make (essential for many TerosHDL features).

Schematics (Optional but recommended): yosys and python3-pip.
